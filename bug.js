This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions.  The problem is that the `Dimensions` API returns an object that isn't immediately updated when the device orientation changes.  This can lead to components rendering with incorrect dimensions, especially if the orientation change happens rapidly.  For example, a component might initially render correctly in portrait mode, but then fail to update its layout appropriately after rotating the device to landscape, resulting in clipping or misaligned elements.

```javascript
import { Dimensions, View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      {/* Content that depends on width and height */}
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    width: width,
    height: height,
    backgroundColor: 'red',
  },
});

export default MyComponent;
```
